Universal Login documentation
=============================

Universal Login is a design pattern for storing funds and connecting to Ethereum applications, aiming to simplify new users on-boarding.

This documentation covers all components of the project including sdk, relayer, smart contracts and example.

Disclaimer
----------
Universal Login is a work in progress and is at the experimental stage. Expect breaking changes. The code is not stable and has not been audited and therefore should not be used in a production environment
